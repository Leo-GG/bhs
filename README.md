Hi there, welcome to the bhs repository! 🙌

This is a place where you can find learning resources for the Bioinformatics course I coordinate at the School of Medicine of University of Minho in Portugal. 🇵🇹

Bioinformatics is a fascinating field that combines biology, computer science, and mathematics to analyze and interpret biological data. 🧬💻📊

Whether you are interested in DNA sequences, protein structures, or gene expression, this course will help you develop the tools and methods you need to explore the secrets of life. 🔬🔎👩‍🔬

In this repository, you will find:

- **python_intro.ipynb**: This is a Jupyter Notebook file that contains Python code and explanations about the basic concepts of the language. Python is one of the most popular and powerful programming languages in the world, and it is widely used in bioinformatics. 🐍
    - The file covers topics such as variables, data types, operators, control structures, functions, modules, and classes. The file also includes examples and exercises to help you learn Python. 📝
    - You can open this file in Google Colaboratory, a free online platform that allows you to run Python code in your browser. To do so, you can click on [this link](^1^). You can use this file as a playground to experiment with Python and modify the code as you wish. 😊
- More files coming soon! Stay tuned for updates on this repository. 🚀

I hope you enjoy this course and learn a lot from it. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me at nunososorio@med.uminho.pt. 😃

Happy coding! 🎉
